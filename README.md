# ThreeJS
a simple program that will render a 3d cube with spin. 

For this program I'll be following along with Sonar Systems on Youtube. It's a solid start to understanding threeJS which will ultimately guide me to Bruno Simons Ultimate ThreeJS course.

I will begin my first file with some basics like camera, rendering, and perspective. 
In my second go at the files I'll add things like the actual geometry items, which will use the threejs library to insert Material into my program. I will also add a rotation feature which will allow me to begin understanding dynamics of this library while maintaining my goal of ultimately creating an immersive web experience. Again, this project is being built as a learning guide for myself as I comprehend this new library and it's features.
